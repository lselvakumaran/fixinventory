        note bottom of ServicePrincipal
          "Instantiates" an application per organization
          Also means: there can be a principal without
          application in case of multi tenant apps.

        note left of ConditionalAccessPolicy
        grants or denies specific things
        based on principal, location, device, etc.
        Example:
        "Enforce MFA from Untrusted Locations"
        end note

        <> Principal
        Principal ..> User

        Principal ..> Group
        Principal ..> ManagedIdentity

          No reference to any Principal
          Generic rules that apply to all resources.
