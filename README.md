# Getting started
Cloudkeeper is “housekeeping for clouds” - find leaky resources, manage quota limits, detect drift and clean up. 

Infrastructure management tools like Terraform and CloudFormation do a good job at managing resources they know about. But they do a poor job at managing resources they did not create. 

You can see drift in your environment, but only if the tool itself created the left-behind artifacts. The unknown drift makes it hard for developers and engineers to discover, understand and take action on resources. 
Cloudkeeper fixes that gap in your environment.  

# Quick start
In this quick start guide, we’re showing you three things, how to:

    1. install Cloudkeeper for AWS with docker
    2. use the Cloudkeeper CLI to run your first collect process
    3. query the results of the collect process 

The docker set-up takes 2-5 minutes. The duration of the first collect process depends on the size of your environment - usually 2-5 minutes. 

Examples and data in this documentation are based on a small AWS [cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) environment.  
To start exploring you need AWS credentials and a working docker environment with access to AWS APIs.  
We assume you are familiar with basic docker operations and how to operate a linux shell.
