## Overview
`resotometrics` takes [`resotocore`](../resotocore/) graph data and runs aggregation functions on it. Those aggregated metrics
are then exposed in a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) compatible format. The default TCP port is `9955` but
can be changed using the `--web-port` argument.


## Usage
`resotometrics` uses the following commandline arguments:
```
  --web-port WEB_PORT   TCP port to listen on (default: 9955)
  --resotocore-uri RESOTOCORE_URI
                        resotocore URI (default: http://localhost:8900)
  --resotocore-ws-uri RESOTOCORE_WS_URI
                        resotocore Websocket URI (default: ws://localhost:8900)
  --resotocore-graph RESOTOCORE_GRAPH
                        resotocore graph name (default: resoto)
  --timeout TIMEOUT     Metrics generation timeout in seconds (default: 300)
  --verbose, -v         Verbose logging
  --logfile LOGFILE     Logfile to log into
```

ENV Prefix: `RESOTOMETRICS_`
Every CLI arg can also be specified using ENV variables.

For instance the boolean `--verbose` would become `RESOTOMETRICS_VERBOSE=true` or `--timeout 300` would become `RESOTOMETRICS_TIMEOUT=300`.

Once started `resotometrics` will register for `generate_metrics` core events. When such an event is received it will
generate Resoto metrics and provide them at the `/metrics` endpoint.

A prometheus config could look like this:
```
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "resotometrics"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9955"]
```

## Details
Resoto core supports aggregated queries to produce metrics. Our common library [`resotolib`](../resotolib/) define a number of base resources that are common to a lot of cloud proviers, like say compute instances, subnets, routers, load balancers, and so on. All of those ship with a standard set of metrics specific to each resource.

For example, instances have CPU cores and memory, so they define default metrics for those attributes. Right now metrics are hard coded and read from the base resources, but future versions of Resoto will allow you to define your own metrics in `resotocore` and have `resotometrics` export them.

For right now you can use the aggregate API at `{resotocore}:8900/graph/{graph}/reported/query/aggregate` or the `aggregate` CLI command to generate your own metrics. For API details check out the `resotocore` API documentation as well as the Swagger UI at `{resotocore}:8900/api-doc/`.

In the following we will be using the Resoto shell `resh` and the `aggregate` command.


### Example
Enter the following commands into `resh`
```
query is(instance) | merge_ancestors cloud,account,region | aggregate reported.cloud.name as cloud, reported.account.name as account, reported.region.name as region, reported.instance_type as type : sum(1) as instances_total, sum(reported.instance_cores) as cores_total, sum(reported.instance_memory*1024*1024*1024) as memory_bytes
```

Here is the same query with line feeds for readability (can not be copy'pasted)
```
query is(instance) |
  merge_ancestors
    cloud,account,region |
  aggregate
    reported.cloud.name as cloud,
    reported.account.name as account,
    reported.region.name as region,
    reported.instance_type as type :
  sum(1) as instances_total,
  sum(reported.instance_cores) as cores_total,
  sum(reported.instance_memory*1024*1024*1024) as memory_bytes
```

If your graph contains any compute instances the resulting output will look something like this
```
---
group:
  cloud: aws
  account: someengineering-platform
  region: us-west-2
  type: m5.2xlarge
instances_total: 6
cores_total: 24
memory_bytes: 96636764160
---
group:
  cloud: aws
  account: someengineering-platform
  region: us-west-2
  type: m5.xlarge
instances_total: 8
cores_total: 64
memory_bytes: 257698037760
---
group:
  cloud: gcp
  account: someengineering-dev
  region: us-west1
  type: n1-standard-4
instances_total: 12
cores_total: 48
memory_bytes: 193273528320
```

Let us dissect what we've written here:
- `query is(instance)` fetch all the resources that inherit from base kind `instance`. This would be compute instances like `aws_ec2_instance` or `gcp_instance`.
- `merge_ancestors cloud,account,region` merge the resulting instances with their ancestor resources (meaning their parents and parent parents higher up the graph going towards the graph root) so that we can aggregate by cloud name, account name and so on.
- `aggregate reported.cloud.name as cloud, reported.account.name as account, reported.region.name as region, reported.instance_type as type` aggregate the instance metrics by `cloud`, `account`, and `region` name as well as `instance_type` (think `GROUP_BY` in SQL).
- `sum(1) as instances_total, sum(reported.instance_cores) as cores_total, sum(reported.instance_memory*1024*1024*1024) as memory_bytes` sum up the total number of instances, number of instance cores and memory. The later is stored in GB and here we convert it to bytes as is customary in Prometheus exporters.


### Taking it one step further
```
query is(instance) and reported.instance_status = running | merge_ancestors cloud,account,region,instance_type as parent_instance_type | aggregate reported.cloud.name as cloud, reported.account.name as account, reported.region.name as region, reported.instance_type as type : sum(reported.parent_instance_type.ondemand_cost) as instances_hourly_cost_estimate
```

Again the same query with line feeds for readbility (can not be copy'pasted)
```
query is(instance) and reported.instance_status = running |
  merge_ancestors
    cloud,account,region,instance_type as parent_instance_type |
  aggregate
    reported.cloud.name as cloud,
    reported.account.name as account,
    reported.region.name as region,
    reported.instance_type as type :
  sum(reported.parent_instance_type.ondemand_cost) as instances_hourly_cost_estimate
```

Outputs something like
```
---
group:
  cloud: gcp
  account: maestro-229419
  region: us-central1
  type: n1-standard-4
instances_hourly_cost_estimate: 0.949995
```

What did we do here? We told Resoto to find all resource of type compute instance (`query is(instance)`) with a status of `running` and then merge the result with ancestors (parents and parent parents) of type `cloud`, `account`, `region` and now also `instance_type`.

Let us look at two things here. First, in the previous example we already aggregated by `instance_type`. However this was the string attribute called `instance_type` that is part of every instance resource and contains strings like `m5.xlarge` (AWS) or `n1-standard-4` (GCP).

Example
```
> query is(instance) | tail -1 | format {reported.kind} {reported.name} {reported.instance_type}
aws_ec2_instance i-039e06bb2539e5484 t2.micro
```

What we did now was ask Resoto to go up the graph and find the directly connected resource of kind `instance_type`.

An `instance_type` resource looks something like this
```
> query is(instance_type) | tail -1
reported:
  kind: aws_ec2_instance_type
  id: t2.micro
  tags: {}
  name: t2.micro
  instance_type: t2.micro
  instance_cores: 1
  instance_memory: 1
  ondemand_cost: 0.0116
  ctime: '2021-09-28T13:10:08Z'
```

As you can see, the instance type resource has a float attribute called `ondemand_cost` which is the hourly cost a cloud provider charges for this particular type of compute instance. In our aggregation query we now sum up the hourly cost of all currently running compute instances and export them as a metric named `instances_hourly_cost_estimate`. If we now export this metric into a timeseries DB like Prometheus we are able to plot our instance cost over time.

This is the core functionality `resotometrics` provides.
