Setup individual components
###########################

The :ref:`quickstart` guide used our Docker image. This tutorial will set up the individual components that make up a Cloudkeeper environment.

In this setup guide we're showing you three things:
    #. how to prepare your environment
    #. how to install each cloudkeeper component
    #. how to run & access each component

Prerequisites
*************

Python >= 3.9 is required for all Cloudkeeper components. ArangoDB >= 3.8.1 is used as the ``ckcore`` graph storage.
Optionally the Cloudkeeper Metrics Exporter ``ckmetrics`` can be installed and its metrics pulled by the Prometheus time series database.

The component set-up takes 20 minutes. The duration of the first collect process depends on the size of your environment - usually 5-10 minutes.

To start filling the Cloudkeeper graph with resource data you will need AWS credentials.
We assume you have done our :ref:`quickstart`.

Prepare your environment
************************

.. _configuration_environment:

Configuration
=============

Every Cloudkeeper component can be configured via environment variables instead of parameters.
In this section we will prepare all Configurations you need for your examples in one place.
Each component has it's own prefix.

* :ref:`component-ckcore`: ``CKCORE_``
* :ref:`component-ckworker`: ``CKWORKER_``
* :ref:`component-ckmetrics`: ``CKMETRICS_``
* :ref:`component-cksh`: ``CKSH_``

Example for ``ckcore``
------------------

ENV Prefix: ``CKCORE_``

Every CLI arg can also be specified using ENV variables.

For instance ``--graphdb-server http://foobar.tld:8529`` would become ``CKCORE_GRAPHDB_SERVER=http://foobar.tld:8529``.

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Defining configurations for your environment

    export GRAPHDB_DATABASE_DIRECTORY="~/cloudkeeper/db"   #<-- directory to store arangodb data
    export GRAPHDB_SERVER_ENDPOINT="tcp://127.0.0.1:8529"  #<-- destination IP:Port to connect to arangodb
    export GRAPHDB_ROOT_PASSWORD="<SETTHISTOSTHSAFE>"      #<-- arangodb root password

    export CKCORE_GRAPHDB_LOGIN="cloudkeeper"              #<-- user for arangodb database
    export CKCORE_GRAPHDB_PASSWORD="<SETTHISTOSTHOTHER>"   #<-- password for arangodb user
    export CKCORE_GRAPHDB_DATABASE="cloudkeeper"           #<-- database name in arangodb
    export CKCORE_URI="http://127.0.0.1:8900"              #<-- destination IP:Port to connect to ckcore API
    export CKCORE_WS_URI="ws://127.0.0.1:8900"             #<-- destination IP:Port to connect to ckcore API via Websocket
    export CKCORE_GRAPH="ck"                               #<-- name of the graph to store your cloud data

    mkdir -p ${GRAPHDB_DATABASE_DIRECTORY}                 #<-- create data directory for arangodb

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Optional preperations for :ref:`prometheus`

    export TSDB_DATABASE_DIRECTORY="~/cloudkeeper/tsdb"    #<-- directory to store prometheus data
    export TSDB_CONFIG_FILE="/path/to/tsdb/prometheus.yml" #<-- location of prometheus configuration file
    export TSDB_RETENTION_TIME="-730d"                     #<-- retention time for prometheus data

    mkdir -p ${TSDB_DATABASE_DIRECTORY}                    #<-- create data directory for arangodb

.. _arangodb:

ArangoDB
========

Run
---

Our defaults run fine but things like ``GRAPHDB_ROOT_PASSWORD`` need to be changed for non-laptop-environments.

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: run ArangoDB

    $ /usr/local/db/bin/arangod --database.directory "${GRAPHDB_DATABASE_DIRECTORY}" \
      --server.endpoint "${GRAPHDB_SERVER_ENDPOINT}" \
      --database.password "${GRAPHDB_ROOT_PASSWORD}"

Prepare graph database for ``ckcore``
-------------------------------------

Now you need to prepare the graph database for ``ckcore``.

You will add an user for ``ckcore``, create a database and grant privileges for the user to access the database.

Our defaults run fine but things like ``GRAPHDB_ROOT_PASSWORD`` or ``CKCORE_GRAPHDB_PASSWORD`` need to be changed for non-laptop-environments.

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Run ArangoSH to configure graph database

    $ arangosh --console.history false --server.password "${GRAPHDB_ROOT_PASSWORD}"
    > const users = require('@arangodb/users');
    > users.save('<manually replace with CKCORE_GRAPHDB_LOGIN content>', '<manually replace with CKCORE_GRAPHDB_PASSWORD content>');
    > db._createDatabase('<manually replace with CKCORE_GRAPHDB_DATABASE content>');
    > users.grantDatabase('<manually replace with CKCORE_GRAPHDB_LOGIN content>', '<manually replace with CKCORE_GRAPHDB_DATABASE content>', 'rw');

Install Cloudkeeper components
******************************

.. _setup-ckcore:

ckcore
======

Install ckcore
--------------

You install :ref:`component-ckcore` via python pip directly from our git repository.
Please make sure you have git installed.
First you need to install :ref:`cklib` as a dependency to :ref:`setup-ckcore`.

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Install cklib und ckcore

    $ pip3 install "git+https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper.git@2.0.0a4#egg=cklib&subdirectory=cklib"
    $ pip3 install "git+https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper.git@2.0.0a4#egg=ckcore&subdirectory=ckcore"

Usage
-----
You can access :ref:`setup-ckcore` help via ``$ ckcore --help``

Every CLI arg can also be specified using ENV variables, see :ref:`configuration_environment` for examples.

Run ckcore
----------
Now you can start and connect :ref:`setup-ckcore` to the previous setup of :ref:`arangodb`.
Please match your parameter values with the ones used while preparing :ref:`arangodb`.

We add the ``--log-level debug`` on first start to get used to what is happening exactly.
You can skip this argument later to reduce log output volume when all components are set up.

Add --graphdb-server if :ref:`arangodb` is running on another instance or port.

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Run ckcore

    $ ckcore --log-level debug \
      --graphdb-server ${GRAPHDB_SERVER_ENDPOINT:-tcp://127.0.0.1:8529} \
      --graphdb-database ${CKCORE_GRAPHDB_DATABASE:-cloudkeeper} \
      --graphdb-username ${CKCORE_GRAPHDB_LOGIN:-cloudkeeper} \
      --graphdb-password ${CKCORE_GRAPHDB_PASSWORD:-changeme}

.. code-block:: console

    (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Secure ckcore
-------------

To enforce authentication for connections to :ref:`setup-ckcore` provide ``--psk "YOURVERYSECUREPRESHAREDKEY"`` as parameter on startup.

.. _setup-cksh:

cksh
====

Install cksh
------------

You install :ref:`component-cksh` via python pip directly from our git repository.
Please make sure you have git installed.

If not already done in the :ref:`setup-ckcore` section, you need to install :ref:`cklib` as a dependency to :ref:`setup-cksh`.

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Install cklib und cksh

    $ pip3 install "git+https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper.git@2.0.0a4#egg=cklib&subdirectory=cklib"
    $ pip3 install "git+https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper.git@2.0.0a4#egg=cksh&subdirectory=cksh"

Usage
-----

You can access :ref:`setup-cksh` help via ``$ cksh --help``

Every CLI arg can also be specified using ENV variables, see :ref:`configuration_environment` for examples.

Run cksh
----------
Now you can connect :ref:`setup-cksh` to the previous setup :ref:`setup-ckcore`.
Please match your parameter values to reflect your environment while running :ref:`setup-ckcore`.

We add the ``--verbose`` on first start to get used to what is happening exactly.
You can skip this argument later to reduce log output volume when all components are set up.

Add ``--ckcore-uri`` and ``--ckcore-ws-uri`` if :ref:`setup-ckcore` is running on another instance or port.
Add ``--ckcore-graph`` if you defined another name of the graph for :ref:`setup-ckworker`

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Run cksh

    $ cksh --verbose \
      --ckcore-uri ${CKCORE_URI:-http://127.0.0.1:8900} \
      --ckcore-ws-uri ${CKCORE_WS_URI:-ws://127.0.0.1:8900} \

.. _setup-ckworker:

ckworker
========

Install ckworker
----------------

You install :ref:`component-ckworker` via python pip directly from our git repository.
Please make sure you have git installed.
First you need to install :ref:`cklib` as a dependency to :ref:`setup-ckworker` as well.

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Install cklib und ckworker

    $ pip3 install "git+https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper.git@2.0.0a4#egg=cklib&subdirectory=cklib"
    $ pip3 install "git+https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper.git@2.0.0a4#egg=ckworker&subdirectory=ckworker"


.. _plugins:

ckworker plugins
----------------

As :ref:`setup-ckworker` needs plugins to actually do something you need to install them, too.
A full list of available plugins can be found in the cloudkeeper `repository <https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper/tree/main/plugins>`_

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Install plugins

    pip3 install "git+https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper.git@2.0.0a4#egg=cloudkeeper-plugin-aws&subdirectory=plugins/aws"
    pip3 install "git+https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper.git@2.0.0a4#egg=cloudkeeper-plugin-example_collector&subdirectory=plugins/example_collector"

    pip3 install "git+https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper.git@2.0.0a4#egg=cloudkeeper-plugin-vsphere&subdirectory=plugins/vsphere"

Usage
-----
You can access :ref:`setup-ckworker` help via ``$ ckworker --help``

Every CLI arg can also be specified using ENV variables, see :ref:`configuration_environment` for examples.

*Important*: Every plugin will add its own CLI args to those of :ref:`setup-ckworker`. Check the individual plugin documentation for details or use ``ckworker --help`` to see the complete list.

Run ckworker
------------
Now you can connect :ref:`setup-ckworker` to the previous setup :ref:`setup-ckcore`.
Please match your parameter values to reflect your environment while running :ref:`setup-ckcore`.

We add the ``--verbose`` on first start to get used to what is happening exactly.
You can skip this argument later to reduce log output volume when all components are set up.

Add ``--ckcore-uri`` and ``--ckcore-ws-uri`` if :ref:`setup-ckcore` is running on another instance or port.

Add ``--ckcore-graph`` if you want to change the default name of the graph in the database to something other than 'ck'.
Keep in mind that you need to adjust ``--ckcore-graph`` for :ref:`setup-cksh` and :ref:`setup-ckmetrics`, too.

As we are using AWS in this example, please replace ``--aws-access-key-id`` and ``--aws-secret-access-key`` with values matching your environment.

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Run ckworker

    $ ckworker --verbose \

Let us unpack this command

- ``fork`` makes :ref:`setup-ckworker` fork each collector plugin instead of using threads
- ``collector aws`` loads the AWS collector plugin
- ``aws-fork`` tells the AWS collector plugin to also use forked processes instead of threads
- ``aws-access-key-id/-secret-access-key`` AWS credentials for API access. Instead of using credentials directly you can also opt to inherit them from the `awscli <https://aws.amazon.com/cli/>`_ environment or when running on EC2 using an instance profile.
- ``aws-role`` the IAM role Cloudkeeper should assume when making API requests
- ``aws-scrape-org`` tells the AWS collector plugin to retrieve a list of all org accounts and then assume into each one of them.

The reason for using forked processes instead of threads is to work around performance limitations of Python's `GIL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock>`_. By forking we almost scale linearly with the number of CPU cores when collecting many accounts at once. The default is to use threads to conserve system resources.

.. _setup-ckmetrics:

ckmetrics
=========

Install ckmetrics
-----------------

You install :ref:`component-ckmetrics` via python pip directly from our git repository.
Please make sure you have git installed.

If not already done in the :ref:`setup-ckcore` section, you need to install :ref:`cklib` as dependency to :ref:`setup-ckmetrics` as well.

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Install cklib und ckmetrics

    $ pip3 install "git+https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper.git@2.0.0a4#egg=cklib&subdirectory=cklib"
    $ pip3 install "git+https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper.git@2.0.0a4#egg=ckmetrics&subdirectory=ckmetrics"

Usage
-----

You can access :ref:`setup-ckmetrics` help via ``$ ckmetrics --help``

Every CLI arg can also be specified using ENV variables, see :ref:`configuration_environment` for examples.

Once started :ref:`setup-ckmetrics` will register for ``generate_metrics`` core events. When such an event is received it will
generate Cloudkeeper metrics and provide them at the ``/metrics`` endpoint.

For prometheus, setup your configuration needs to contain this configuration snippet.

Adjust the ``targets`` to match your ckmetrics configuration

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: :ref:`prometheus` configuration snippet

    scrape_configs:
    - job_name: "ckmetrics"
        static_configs:
        - targets: ["localhost:9955"]

Run ckmetrics
-------------
Now you can connect :ref:`setup-ckmetrics` to the previous setup :ref:`setup-ckcore` as well as let your prometheus connect to :ref:`setup-ckmetrics`.
Please match your parameter values to reflect your environment while running :ref:`setup-ckcore`.

We add the ``--verbose`` on first start to get used to what is happening exactly.
You can skip this argument later to reduce log output volume when all components are set up.

Add ``--ckcore-uri`` and ``--ckcore-ws-uri`` if :ref:`setup-ckcore` is running on another instance or port.
Add ``--ckcore-graph`` if you defined another name of the graph for :ref:`setup-ckworker`

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Run ckmetrics

    $ ckmetrics --verbose \
      --ckcore-uri ${CKCORE_URI:-http://127.0.0.1:8900} \
      --ckcore-ws-uri ${CKCORE_WS_URI:-ws://127.0.0.1:8900} \
      --ckcore-graph ${CKCORE_GRAPH:-ck}

You can now access the metrics interface via `ckmetrics <http://localhost:9955/metrics>`_.

.. _prometheus:
