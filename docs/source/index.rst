Getting started
===============
Cloudkeeper is “housekeeping for clouds” - find leaky resources, manage quota limits, detect drift and clean up. 

Infrastructure management tools like Terraform and CloudFormation do a good job at managing resources they know about. But they do a poor job at managing resources they did not create. 

You can see drift in your environment, but only if the tool itself created the left-behind artifacts. The unknown drift makes it hard for developers and engineers to discover, understand and take action on resources. 
Cloudkeeper fixes that gap in your environment.
