Welcome to the official Cloudkeeper documentation!

What is Cloudkeeper?
********************

The official `GitHub repository can be found here <https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper>`_.

Cloudkeeper indexes resources, captures dependencies and maps out your infrastructure in an understandable graph. The graph contains metrics for each resource.

Developers and SREs can **search the graph with a query language**, and create **alerting and clean-up workflows**.

Metrics can be aggregated and exported to a time series database like Prometheus.

Is Cloudkeeper the tool I am looking for?
-----------------------------------------

If you ever

- had a standstill in your CI pipeline because a broken job leaked cloud resources which triggered a quota limit
- wanted to find all expired certificate
- had to change the tags of thousands of EC2 instances at once
- needed to delete all unused EBS volumes that had no I/O in the past month
- wished for a god view that lets you explore all cloud usage across all clouds
- reported the cost of a project across different accounts or even across clouds
- cleaned up orphaned load balancers that had no active backends
- wanted to automate any of the above

then you know the kind of situations Cloudkeeper was built for and you will love it.

Supported Clouds and Integrations
*********************************
Cloudkeeper collects data using simple plugins written in Python.

**The following plugins are supplied at the moment:**

- AWS
- Google Cloud
- VMWare Vsphere
- OneLogin
- Kubernetes
- Slack

The latter can also be used for notification of resource cleanups.

.. hint::
    If the cloud or service you are using is not listed, it is easy to write your own collector plugin.

    Here is an `example plugin <https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper/blob/main/plugins/example_collector>`_.
