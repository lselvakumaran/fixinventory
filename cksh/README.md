## Overview
`cksh` starts the Cloudkeeper shell. It is used to interact with `ckcore`. It allows you to explore the graph, find resources of interest, mark them for cleanup, fix their tagging, aggregate over their metadata to create metrics and format the output for use in a 3rd party script or system.


## Usage
`cksh` uses the following commandline arguments:
```
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --ckcore-uri CKCORE_URI
                        ckcore URI (default: http://localhost:8900)
  --ckcore-ws-uri CKCORE_WS_URI
                        ckcore Websocket URI (default: ws://localhost:8900)
  --ckcore-graph CKCORE_GRAPH
                        ckcore graph name (default: ck)
  --stdin               Read from STDIN instead of opening a shell
  --verbose, -v         Verbose logging
  --logfile LOGFILE     Logfile to log into
```

ENV Prefix: `CKSH_`
Every CLI arg can also be specified using ENV variables.

For instance `--ckcore-uri http://foobar.tld:8900` would become `CKSH_CKCORE_URI=http://foobar.tld:8900`.

Available Aliases:

   start_workflow (start_task) - Start a task with the given name.
   start_job (start_task) - Start a task with the given name.

Note that you can pipe commands using the pipe character (|)
and chain multiple commands using the semicolon (;).

Using `help` followed by a command will provide more information about that command.

> help query
query - Matches a property in all sections.

Usage: query [--include-edges] [--explain] <property.path> <op> <value"

Part of a query.
With this command you can query all sections directly.
In order to define the section, all parameters have to be prefixed by the section name.

The property is the complete path in the json structure.
Operation is one of: <=, >=, >, <, ==, !=, =~, !~, in, not in
value is a json encoded value to match.

Use --explain to understand the cost of a query. A query explanation has this form (example):
{
    "available_nr_items": 142670,
    "estimated_cost": 61424,
    "estimated_nr_items": 1,
    "full_collection_scan": false,
    "rating": "Simple"
}

- `available_nr_items` describe the number of all available nodes in the graph.
- `estimated_cost` shows the absolute cost of this query. See rating for an interpreted number.
- `estimated_nr_items` estimated number of items returned for this query.
                       It is computed based on query statistics and heuristics and does not reflect the real number.
- `full_collection_scan` indicates, if a full collection scan is required.
                         In case this is true, the query does not take advantage of any indexes.
- `rating` The more general rating of this query.
           Simple: The estimated cost is fine - the query will most probably run smoothly.
           Complex: The estimated cost is quite high. Check other properties. Maybe an index can be used?
           Bad: The estimated cost is very high. It will most probably run long and/or will take a lot of resources.

Parameter:
    --include-edges: This flag indicates, that not only nodes should be returned, but also all related edges.
    --explain: Instead of executing this query, explain the query cost

Example:
    query reported.prop1 == "a"          # matches documents with reported section like { "prop1": "a" ....}
    query desired.some.nested in [1,2,3] # matches documents with desired section like { "some": { "nested" : 1 ..}
    query reported.array[*] == 2         # matches documents with reported section like { "array": [1, 2, 3] ... }
    query reported.array[1] == 2         # matches documents with reported section like { "array": [1, 2, 3] ... }
    query --include-edges is(graph_root) -[0:2]-> # returns the descendants from the graph root 2 levels deep
    query --explain is(graph_root) -[0:2]->       # Shows the query cost of provided query
```


### Intermediate
Show all storage volumes that are in use
```
> match is(volume) and volume_status = in-use
```

Show all storage volumes in use and format the output as CSV
```
> match is(volume) and volume_status = in-use | format {reported.kind},{reported.id},{reported.name},{reported.ctime}
```

Show all storage volumes not in use with a size of more than 10 GB
```
> match is(volume) and volume_status = available and volume_size > 10
```


### Advanced
The `match` command is an alias for `reported` meaning it is searching in the reported section of the resource. To query outside the reported section we have to use the `query` command. The syntax is like before just that now whenever we want to filter for an attribute within the reported section we will have to prefix that attribute accordingly.

Find volumes in cloud AWS that are in use
```
query is(volume) and reported.volume_status = in-use and metadata.ancestors.cloud.name = aws
```

Alternatively instead of filtering for storage volumes of the generic `volume` kind we can also be more specific
```
match is(aws_ec2_volume) and volume_status = in-use
```

Find unused AWS volumes older than 30 days with no I/O in the past 7 days
```
match is(aws_ec2_volume) and volume_status = available and ctime < -30d and atime < -7d and mtime < -7d
```
